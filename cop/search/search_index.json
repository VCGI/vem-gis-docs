CONUS = Continental United States, BREF = Base Reflectivity, which is the \"raw\" echo intensity from the lowest tilt of the radar (0.5\u00b0), which shows what is happening closest to the ground, and QCD = Quality Controlled Data. This means the NWS has run an algorithm to remove \"non-meteorological\" noise, such as ground clutter (buildings/mountains) or sun spikes, to clean up the image.
